## What is the Job?
Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative Ltd (NBRC) is seeking a new member to work in our busy workshop based at the University of East Anglia Campus. We are a fully mutual workers’ co-op so our permanent employees (members) are all directors of the business and not only do the mechanical repairs work of the business but share responsibility for management too.

NBRC is a growing business serving the students and staff of UEA and the local area. We formed in November 2013, and we’re already in high demand, delivering the UEA Dr Bike contract and we have scope for further expansion in the future. We’re a not-for-profit organisation with a strong ethical and environmental ethos.
