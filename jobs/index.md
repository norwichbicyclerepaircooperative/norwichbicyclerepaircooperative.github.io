# Job Vacancies

{% capture sidebar_text %} Are you an aspirant female cycle mechanic?

We especially encourage applications from women, as they are under-represented in the cycle trade and as one of the aims of our project is to provide a female-friendly service.

Selection for the job will, of course, be made on merit and we welcome applications from everyone with an enthusiasm to join our project. {% endcapture %} {% include sidebar.html %}

__Current Vacancy:__ Co-op member/Bicycle Repair person/Project co-manager (training provided), closing
date for applications 15th June 2015, 2pm.

#### Please read all the information below carefully - we will only consider applications that provide all the information we have asked for.

## What is the Job?

Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative Ltd (NBRC) is seeking a new member to work
in its busy workshop based at the University of East Anglia Campus. NBRC is a
fully mutual workers' co-op, so our permenant employees (members) are all directors of the business and
not only do the routine work of the business but share the responsibility for management too. 

NBRC is relatively new, we formed in November 2013, however we're already
in high demand delivering the UEA Dr Bike contract and have scope for further expansion
in the future. We're a not-for-profit organisation with a strong ethical and
environmental ethos.

####The job we need to fill will, following training, involve:

* Mending and refurbishing bicycles to a professional standard
* Undertaking routine record keeping associated with running a bicycle shop and
  workshop
* Undertaking bicycle safety checks
* Explaining our services, repairs and products to services users and taking payments
* Taking shared responsibility for the running, financial management and
  development of the business
* Taking shared responsibility for the mundane, but necessary, tasks like
  cleaning up, washing up and maintenance.
* Working co-operatively with other members, including attending managment meetings.
* Anything else that should arise - we're a new business so new challenges are a
  reasonably regular occurrence!

__You won't need to do all these things right away, but you will need to be able
to contribute to some of them from the beginning and be willing to learn the
rest.__

We're looking for someone who wants to do more than just mend bikes, but is also
interested in becoming a full and active member of our Co-operative with joint
responsibility for the organisation, management and development of our young
business. This is not the kind of post where you just turn up, do work and go
home - we're looking to recruit someone who's passionate about bikes, really
cares about what NBRC is trying to do and shares our environmental and ethical
goals. We're also looking for someone who has commitment to the job as the trial
period for membership takes 6-9 months and really getting up to speed with all
aspects of the job may take even longer.

##Hours and Pay

The job is initially for 24-26 hours per week.  We will need you to work full days
(8-9hours) Thursday and Fridays and there will be a choice to work either Tuesday
or Wednesday or to split your remaining hours between these two days.  There may be 
scope to extend your hours in the future. If you get to the interview stage we will
want to discuss exactly which hours and days you will work, but it will need to be
a minimum average of 24 per week during our normal opening hours (8.30am - 4.30pm, 
Monday to Friday), so make sure you are able to do this before applying.

The job also has above the statutory minimum (5.6 weeks) paid holiday, though
holiday periods are fixed in advance based on our contractual obligations.
There are currently 6 full weeks plus UK Bank Holidays where we do not trade,
forthcoming dates until the end of 2016 can be found [here](/holiday-dates/).

The starting wage will be £7.05 per hour; rising to a minimum of £7.85 per hour (or
the current living wage as set by [The Living Wage Foundation](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/) if you
succeed in being accepted as a full member (as a full member you'll be involved in
deciding how wages are set - we always aim to make these a fair reflection of the 
responsibility associated with each particular job within the co-op).

## How do I apply?

If you would like to apply for this position please read the __five__ Job Applicant
Criteria below which describe the aptitudes and skills we are looking for. If
you still think you'd like to apply then write us a letter explaining why you
would like to be a member of our co-op, making sure it includes information
about your skills, experience and aptitudes for each of the __five__ criteria.

####We will only be able to consider applications that contain _both_ a letter and a CV

As we've mentioned, it is not necessary to have lots of experience for all the criteria we mention right away. However we would like to see evidence that you've thought about all of the criteria; can show that you have relevant skills and experience in some areas; and have the aptitude to develop areas where you have less experience over the job's trial period.  By aptitude we mean evidence that, for example, you have a systematic, problem-solving approach; you have previously gained proficiency in a craft, mechanical or technical skill and/or you are able to effectively manage your own learning.

Also, while there are a lot of skills we are looking for, "being best at
writing letters" is not the most important of them. So if this application
process seems daunting, it's fine to get some help writing your letter, so long
as the skills and experience you describe in the letter are true and a fair
reflection of your abilities. We'd appreciate it if you mention in your letter
if you've had assistance drafting it.

Please include a copy of your CV with this letter – the CV need only be brief, but must include your contact details __(with email address)__, and the names and addresses of __two referees__.

We can only accept applications that include a letter (written specifically, not a standard covering letter) and a CV.



##Job applicant criteria

### 1) Enthusiastic about bicycles

Being enthusiastic about bicycles and cycling, and interested in promoting
cycling as a sustainable and accessible form of transport are absolutely
essential for this job. It would also be preferable to be an experienced
bicycle user.

It's also important to have a non-elitist attitude to cycling, we serve a
diverse audience of bicycle users and want everyone to feel welcomed.  You will
need to repair and renovate cycles as part of the job, so you must want to do
this and either already have the skills to do so to a high, consistent and
professional standard or be willing to develop them. Previous experience of
working in bicycle repair, or having attended a course of training would be an
advantage, but is not an essential criterion. However if you don't have formal
experience we would want to know at a minimum you can:

* Correctly name and understand the function of most components on common bicycle types
* Know how a bicycle should be set-up to ride
* Can recognise when something is wrong (even if you cannot give a detailed diagnosis, or (currently) carry out the repair).
* Have experience caring for and maintaining your own cycle, or those of friends and family.
* Show aptitude to develop these skills rapidly on the job

Amateur mechanics should also show awareness that the demands of a
professional repair workshop can be quite different from domestic repair and
that they might need to develop and modify their skills, even in areas where
they can already carry out repairs to some extent. Even if you have
professional experience, not all workshops are the same so we will want to know
you have the openness to develop, improve and keep current your skills whatever
your starting point.

We'd also like to know about any related skills, qualifications or experience
you have, for example working in the cycle trade, but in a non-repair role;
bikeability training; membership of cycling clubs or particular types of
cycling you participate in, like touring, mountain biking, stunt cycling,
cycling with children or audax.

### 2) Keen to co-operate

We are a small workers' co-operative. This means that there isn't a manager down the
corridor if we can't solve a problem for ourselves; equally there isn't a fleet
of minions who turn up just to mop the floor or make the tea. Co-ops are a
different type of business to most, with different values and organisational
structures. Probably the most important thing for this job is that you are
able to fit in with our organisation, this means being able to take a
reasonable level of personal responsibility and initiative while still being a
good team player who is willing to muck in.

Being co-operative includes being open, conscientious, easy-going: The thing
about mending bicycles is that it really matters if you go wrong, so it's
important that you take care with your work. And we have to admit where we may
have messed up so we can get to the bottom of problems quickly. Plus we have to
all get on really well or it just won’t work.

Good communication is also key to co-operation.

We'd like to know if you think you have these qualities, giving examples from
your experience if you can.

We'd also like to know of any previous experience you have of working
co-operatively or collectively, either formally as part of a job or voluntary
role or more informally (for example in a food-group or babysitting circle; an
allotment share or as part of a campaigning group).

We'd specifically like to know of any experience you have working in
non-hierarchical groups or of consensus decision making. We are aware these are
ideas that not everyone will have heard about before, let alone had a chance to
work with! We don't believe that you need to have had co-operative experience
in the past to have the potential to be a great co-operator in the future, but
we would like to see evidence that you've taken the time to find out what being
a co-op means and that you are genuinely keen to be part of one.

There's a quick guide to the 7 co-operative principles [here](https://www.ncba.coop/7-cooperative-principles) and there's lots more
information about co-ops on the [Co-operatives UK](http://www.uk.coop) website (including more
information about the co-operative principles).

We endeavour to make decisions using a consensus process. You can find out more
about consensus decision making [here](http://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/resources#grp).

### 3) IT/Admin/Business management and planning:

We mend bikes, but we also have to deal with the practical realities of running
a business. We would like to know that you understand the importance of good
information organisation and record keeping. Mending bicycles and running a
business are both activities that can be fiddly and frustrating, being someone
who is methodical, with good attention to detail is very helpful with this.
Ideally you need a calm approach to problem-solving, following procedures,
tying up loose ends and filling in paperwork is crucial.

In terms of specific skills we would like to know that you are confident with:

* Using spreadsheets (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Open Office/Libre Office Calc)
* Email
* Word processing
* Filling in routine paperwork
* Reasonable numeracy (calculating bills, change etc,)
* Effective internet searches

And also if you are able to/willing to learn:

* Our stock-keeping systems
* Our filling and record keeping systems
* Gnu Cash
* Payroll software
* Online tax returns
* Invoicing

And can show an interest in:

* Business development and planning
* Financial management

We'd specifically like to know of any experience you have in business planning;
financial management; grant funding applications; tax returns or any other
booking keeping and administrative roles.

### 4) Customer relations/communication

Are very important, both for communicating effectively within the co-op and
with service users. Ideally you'll be able to project an out-going and friendly
persona and explain technical problems in plain English. Many of our services
users do not have English as a first language, which can be an additional
challenge when explaining mechanical problems to a non-technical audience.

We'd like to know about any specific language skills you have; and other
relevant experience that shows you are an effective and sympathetic
communicator.

### 5) Other useful skills and qualities

Ability to cope with a hectic environment: Sometimes the service we run gets
very busy and there are a lot of different things going on. At such times it's
important to be able to get your head down and get on, even when there are
potential distractions, and be supportive of the work other co-op members are
trying to do. In such circumstance decisions about priorities often have to be
both quick and flexible. This doesn't happen all the time, but it happens often
enough that if you're likely to be unhappy with hecticness or struggle with
switching between tasks then this isn't the job for you.

A positive social and environmental outlook: People who set up not-for-profit
bicycle repair projects are generally not primarily in it for the money. NBRC
is an associate member of [Radical Routes](http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/),
and sees its work as making a positive contribution to a better world. Knowing
whether you're already involved in activities (paid or unpaid) that aim to
create positive social or environmental change; or make choices in you personal
life to this end will help us know understand whether you share our ethos.

## Deadlines and key dates

The deadline for applications is 2pm on Monday 15th June 2015. We will
email applicants that have been short-listed for interview by 7pm on Monday
22nd June, sorry we will only have time to reply to your application personally
if you have been short-listed for interview.

We will be conducting interviews between June 29th and July 10th. 
We expect the interviews to last 2-3 hours and these will involve
some practical elements so you can demonstrate your knowledge.  You will need
to bring proof that you are eligible to work in the UK to your interview.

##What happens next?

The successful applicant for this post will initially be recruited as an
employee of NBRC on a temporary contract for between 6 and 9 months (depending
on initial skill level). During this trial period either the applicant or NBRC
can terminate the contract with 4 weeks notice. There will be a clear plan for
demonstrating/developing all the skills and experience needed to become a full
member of NBRC (over the trial period, with routine reviews to monitor
progress). If, at the end of the temporary contract, we are happy with you as a
member of the team we will invite you to become a co-op member, which you can
accept if you wish or leave us. Becoming a full member of NBRC requires
becoming a director of NBRC, is a permanent role and involves having equal
rights and responsibilities within the organisation as all other members.
Applications should be sent to:
