Selection for the job will, of course, be made on merit and we welcome applications from everyone with an enthusiasm to join our project. {% endcapture %} {% include sidebar.html %}

## What are the jobs?
Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative is seeking a __temporary cycle mechanic (with the oportunity to become a full member after 6 months if wanted)__ and a __full permanent member__ to work in our busy workshop based at the University of East Anglia Campus. We are a fully mutual workers’ co-op so our permanent employees (members) are all directors of the business and not only do the mechanical repairs work of the business but share all of the other management tasks and responsibilities too. We wouldn't expect a temporary cycle mechanic to take on these reponsibilities, but we would expect you to be someone who is already experienced in bicycle mechanics, and on board with our ethos. The opportunity is also open to you after 6 months if you find that full membership is something you're drawn to and we're a compatible team.

NBRC is a growing business serving the students and staff of UEA and the local area. We formed in November 2013, and we’re now in high demand delivering the UEA Dr Bike contract and with scope for further expansion in the future. We’re a not-for-profit organisation with a strong ethical and environmental ethos: please make sure you are down with this and know what it involves before applying.
