## [Articles of Association (AKA primary rules)](/downloads/NBRC Articles of Association (primary rules).pdf)

These are the formal rules with which NBRC incorporated as a limited company.
Somewhat dry as general reading, they may be useful for anyone who wishes to
verify that we are a bona fide Co-operative or to verify that our claims to be
fully mutual and not-for-profit are both true and contained within our
constitution.

## [NBRC Secondary rules](/downloads/NBRC Secondary Rules (includes disciplinary and grievance procedures).pdf)

These are the rules that guide the day to day running of our company.  They
include criteria for membership as well as grievance and disciplinary
procedures for members and employees.  May be of interest to members or
employees (current or potential) other people thinking of setting up a co-op.

## [NBRC Standard Employment Contract](/downloads/Employment contract v2.pdf)

All NBRC Job Contracts are based on this template.  Useful for current and
prospective employees.  We are happy for other Co-ops to use and adapt this
template.
