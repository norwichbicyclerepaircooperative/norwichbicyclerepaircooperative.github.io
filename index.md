NBRC is a different type of bicycle business, combining quality bicycle repairs
with a strong social and environmental ethos. 

We repair bicycles of all ages and types, offering a jargon-free service and
helping educate cycle users so they can make informed choices about maintaining
their bikes.

We aim to offer a same day service, first come first served, so bring your bike
in at 8.30am for a same day repair. We get booked up quickly during busy periods
so arrive early to avoid disappointment.

With over 30 years of professional bicycle repair experience in our workshop we offer a comprehensive range of repairs and renovations for bicycles new and old. We specialise in Sturmey Archer and have a selection of second hand parts on hand to get your vintage bicycle back on the road.

### Refurbishing Bicycles

In addition if you're looking for advice on parts, a vintage frame you want built up, or a new set of wheels you would like us to build, we're happy to talk you through the options.
