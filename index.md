### Cycle Repairs

NBRC is a different type of bicycle business, combining quality bicycle
repairs with a strong social and environmental ethos. 

We repair bicycles of all ages and types, offering a jargon-free service and
helping educate cycle users so they can make informed choices about maintaining
their bikes.

We aim to offer a same day service, first come first served, so bring your bike
in for assessment at 8.30am for a same day repair. We get booked up quickly during
busy periods so arrive early to avoid disappointment.

We specialise in Sturmey Archer hubs and have a selection of second hand parts on hand to get your vintage bicycle back on the road.

With over 30 years of professional bicycle repair experience in our workshop we offer a comprehensive range of repairs and renovations for bicycles new and old.

In addition if you're looking for advice on parts, a vintage frame you want built up, or a new set of wheels you would like us to build, we're happy to talk you through the options.
