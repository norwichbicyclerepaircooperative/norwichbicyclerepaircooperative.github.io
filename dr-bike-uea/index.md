 * Free minor adjustments or help setting up you bike to ride
 * Health and Safety Checks (free for UEA Staff and Students)

If you are looking to get your bike repaired the same day it is best to arrive
early, we have repair slots opening up at 8.30am each day and these are
allocated on a first-come first-served basis. Staff and Students can can also
pre-book for a free health and safety checks. We can offer assessment of repair
needs and advice at any time.
