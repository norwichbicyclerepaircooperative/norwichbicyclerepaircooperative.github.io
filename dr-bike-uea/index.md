We offer a full repair service and bike shop and sell refurbished and
guaranteed [bikes for sale](/bikes-for-sale/).

As the provider of Dr Bike @ UEA we offer all students and staff the following services:

### Free Dr Bike Health Checks ###

We will assess your bike and give you a written report with clear and jargon-
free explanations.

For a same day service arrive at at 8.30am to be guaranteed a slot. These are
allocated on a first-come first-served basis, but you can also pre-book in
person or on the phone.

We can also offer on the spot assessment of repair needs and advice at any time.
We may recommend a health check if there are multiple repair issues.

### DIY Area ###

Use our DIY Area for free, with advice from mechanics if you need it (limited during busy periods).

We have:
 * Cycle pumps
 * Free puncture repair guides
 * Oil, rags, brushes and gloves
 * A range of tools, labelled and free to use
 
### Subsidised Brake Labour ###

We're a safety focussed project so _all brake __labour__ is capped at Â£15 for students and staff_, excluding parts. In collaboration with UEA we aim for safe brakes to be as affordable as possible, whether you're having a coaster brake serviced or new pads and cables. (Obviously it can also be less than that for smaller adjustments).

### Education and Workshops ###

Contact us to find out how you can book us to run a workshop for your staff or students
