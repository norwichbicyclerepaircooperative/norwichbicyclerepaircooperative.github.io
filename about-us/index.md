Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative (NBRC) is an ethical business formed in 2013
by Joanna Chitty & Mark Smith.

We are a fully mutual workers' co-operative, with clear social and environmental
aims. As a not-for-profit business all surplus from our work is channelled back
into community benefits, like getting more old bicycles and parts back into
reuse, educating about and promoting cycling and keeping our services as
affordable as possible.

First and foremost we are about quality bicycle repairs. We offer a
comprehensive workshop repair service from our well equipped workshop. But we
want to do more than just mend your bike, we're committed to clear
communication and not up-selling.

We only recommend repairs if they are necessary and will always endeavour to
explain your repair to you. We aim for a friendly, accessible and jargon-free
service. We also offer loads of advice on how to maintain your bike and keep
cycling costs down.

We're also about promoting cycling as a accessible, sustainable, practical and
healthy form of transport

> Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative Ltd aims to be open and accountable, so as
