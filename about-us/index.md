Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative (NBRC) was formed in 2013
by Joanna Chitty & Mark Smith.

We are a fully mutual workers' co-operative, with clear social and environmental
aims. As a not-for-profit business all surplus from our work is channelled back
into community benefits, like getting more old bicycles and parts back into
reuse, educating about and promoting cycling and keeping our services as
affordable as possible.

Cycling and fixing bikes is our passion: we want to help as many people as possible to get back on the road and ride their bikes with confidence. This basic motivation informs everything we do, from our workshop repairs to the advice we give.
We're committed to clear communication and not up-selling. To this end we always endeavour to explain your repair without jargon and with a focus on what your needs are.

In addition we offer workshops and tuition, and plenty of advice on how to maintain your
bike and keep cycling costs down.


> Norwich Bicycle Repair Co-operative Ltd aims to be open and accountable, so as
